                    <p>The Stormlight Archive is an epic fantasy series by the author Brandon Sanderson. The first book, The Way of Kings, was published in 2010. There are currently four books and two novellas published in the series, and it is planned to be a ten book series. The series follows a large cast of characters, so it is hard to give a quick summary.</p>
                    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>Sanderson is a crazy good author. Most fantasy books that tackle the amount that Sanderson does end up really slow, boring, and hard to keep track of what is going on.  Sanderson avoids this expertly in a few ways. His characters feel real and are very likable. He reveals the details of the world slowly, and the world is extremely unqiue.  And lastly, the stories of each character are complex, interesting, and move quickly. I know I am not explaining what happens in the book, but with how big and immersive this series is, I can't do it justice.  It has something in it for everyone. </p>

                    <h2>The Kingkiller Chronicles</h2>

                    <p>The Kingkiller Chronicle is fantasy book series by Patrick Rothfuss. The first book, The Name of the Wind, was published in 2007.  There are currently only two books and one novella in the series, with the third book still in the works. The story follows the main character, Kvothe. The book is split into two, old, ragged Kvothe telling the story of his life to a scribe in his empty bar, and his lifestory as a young musician/adventurer/prodigy.  The present is told in the 3rd person with multiple characters, and the story is told in Kvothe's first person account.</p>
                    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>Rothfuss is a one of a kind storyteller.  Like Sanderson above, he has created a large, interesting fantasy world, and he pulls you in by slowly pulling back the curtain on it.  Kvothe is a "Most Interesting Man in the World" main character, who you will either like or dislike for that reason.  But, then you remember who is telling the story, a strange rough man who owns a bar that no one goes to.  This is a story where you know the end result. Rothfuss tells a story that is full of music, poetry, and magic.  There is a reason that this series has been quickly picked up for a film/tv adaption, with names such as Lin Manuel Miranda hopping on it.</p>

                    <h2>The Wheel of Time</h2>

                    <p>The Wheel of Time is a epic fantasy series by Robert Jordan. The first book, The Eye of the World, was published in 1990. The series has fourteen books, with two companion books and a prequel. Jordan died in 2007 while working on the twelth book. Brandon Sanderson was the author to finish that book, and he split it into three separate books to end the series.</p>
                    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>The Wheel of Time is the chronologically, the next biggest fantasy series after Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Most of the great fantasy authors today grew up being inspired by this series. Jordan's writing is a very Tolkien-esque, having very detailed desciptions of setting and characters, but it does read easier than Tolkien.  It is easy to see how Jordan took the fantasy genre and made it approachable to a slightly younger audience. Some characters and parts of story may seem cliché, but you realize that this series is where it started.  Amazon is currently filming a TV series for the Wheel of Time, and expectations are high. </p>

                    <h2>Norse Mythology</h2>

                    <p>Norse Mythology is a retelling of many Norse myths by Neil Gaiman.  It was published in 2017.  The stories include the creation story, stories about Thor, Loki, and other Aesir, and the end of the world, Ragnarok.</p>
                    <h4>My Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>Gaiman is one of my favorite storytellers. I highly suggest his other books, especially American Gods. This mythology is a great read, and even better audiobook, as it is narrated by Gaiman himself. </p>
